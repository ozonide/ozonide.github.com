title: The Ozonide graph database
---

This is the public website for the [Ozonide][] graph database.

[Ozonide][]    is    an    unstable,   reactive    polyatomic    anion
<tt>O<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup></tt>,            derived            from
ozone[<sup>[wikipedia]</sup>][wikipedia].  Likewise this project is an
unstable  graph database  derived from  [Neo4j][].  It  is  created by
[Tobias Ivarsson][tobias] at [Neo Technology][neotech], thus copyright
is shared between both Tobias  and Neo Technology.  The purpose of the
[Ozonide][]  project   is  to  be  a  highly   flexible  platform  for
experimenting with new features or trying out different implementation
strategies for  future versions of [Neo4j][]. As  such, [Ozonide][] is
not exepected  to be a stable  product, nor is it  expected to exhibit
the   same  levels  of   performance  as   [Neo4j][].   The   API  and
implementation of  [Ozonide][] may change  at any time,  without prior
notice.   If you  are looking  for  a production  ready, stable,  high
performance graph database, I recommend you take [Neo4j][] for a spin.
