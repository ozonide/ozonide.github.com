title: Ozonide is online

I have  started to  work on  the Ozonide project  with the  purpose of
trying out new features or implementation strategies for [Neo4j][]. As
of   today  I   am  publishing   the  first   information   about  the
project. Since I want to host the project publicly on github I believe
it is important to clearly communicate the intent of the project, it's
affiliation to [Neo4j][] and the license used for Ozonide.

Ozonide is published under the  same open source license as [Neo4j][],
the  [GNU   Affero  General   Public  Licence  version   3][agpl]  (or
[AGPLv3][agpl]  for short).  Copyright  of  the code  is  owned by  me
personally as  well as my  employer, Neo Technology.  This  means that
Neo Technology has full freedom to relicense all code from the Ozonide
project for use in future  versions of [Neo4j][]. This implies that if
you wish  to contribute to Ozonide,  you will need to  sign the [Neo4j
Contributor License Agreement][cla].

It might take me a short  while before the first commit of actual code
in this project, but it will soon be available at:
<https://github.com/ozonide/graphdb>.
